## 📘 Overview  

This repository contains the required artifacts for the **CS 320 - Software Testing and Quality Assurance** course.  
It demonstrates applied skills in **unit testing (JUnit)**, **secure coding**, and **quality assurance practices** to deliver **reliable, maintainable software**.

---

## 🧱 Artifacts Included  

| **Project** | **File Type** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Project One: Contact Service** | `Contact.java` & `ContactService.java` | Core Java business logic and data validation rules. |
| | `ContactTest.java` & `ContactServiceTest.java` | Comprehensive JUnit unit tests for constraint and logic verification. |
| **Project Two: Task / Appointment** | `Summary & Reflections Report (DOCX)` | Written reflection analyzing testing strategies and software engineering mindset. |

## 🚀 Module Eight Reflection  

### 🔐 Ensuring Code Functionality and Security  

To ensure my code is both **functional** and **secure**, I combine **comprehensive testing** with **secure development practices**:

- **Functional Testing:**  
  - Created **JUnit test suites** aligned with explicit software requirements.  
  - Designed **positive tests** (expected behavior) and **negative tests** (failure scenarios).  
  - Example: Ensured `firstName` length ≤ 10 characters; invalid inputs like null or oversized strings trigger safe failures.  

- **Security Discipline:**  
  - Practiced **defensive programming** with strict input validation.  
  - Avoided shortcuts that lead to technical debt or code vulnerabilities.  
  - Plan to expand this approach using **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** and **Continuous Integration** pipelines for future projects.

---

### 👥 Interpreting and Incorporating User Needs  

I begin by translating user needs into **functional requirements**, then design and test accordingly.  

- CRUD operations were core to user expectations.  
- Methods such as `addContact`, `updateFirstName`, and `deleteContact` directly correspond to user functionality.  
- Each test (e.g., `testAddContact()`) validates a specific requirement — ensuring the implementation truly meets user intent.

---

### 🧠 Software Design Philosophy  

| **Design Layer** | **Focus** |
|------------------:|:-----------|
| **Data Structure** | Define core structure (`Contact.java`) and enforce validation logic in constructors/setters. |
| **Service Layer** | Manage CRUD operations and encapsulate business rules (`ContactService.java`). |
| **Efficiency Layer** | Leverage performant data access (e.g., `HashMap` for O(1) lookups). |

**Design Principles:**  
My design approach emphasizes **clarity**, **robustness**, and **testability**.  
By separating logic into distinct layers and validating inputs early, I ensure the software remains modular, maintainable, and efficient.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools  

| **Category** | **Tools / Frameworks** |
|---------------|------------------------|
| **Language** | Java |
| **Testing** | JUnit 5 |
| **Version Control** | Git (via Git Bash) & GitHub |
| **IDE** | Eclipse |
| **Documentation** | Markdown & Word (Reflection Report) |

---

## 🌟 Key Takeaways  

- Strengthened understanding of **software testing**, **test automation**, and **validation-driven design**.  
- Learned to think critically about **security, maintainability, and reliability**.  
- Reinforced the discipline of **building quality into every step of development** — not just testing at the end.
